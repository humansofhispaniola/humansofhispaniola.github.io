									<p>The Boston College Pedro Arrupe International Immersion program enables students learn about the complex reality, of people from another country who struggle in poverty from a historical, social, economic, political and religious perspective. The program sends 9 student groups to learn about and combat social injustices in impoverished countries in South America and the Carribean. Our group was made up of 16 members, including students, student leads, and mentors. </p>

									<p>For 8 months prior to the trip, we met weekly for 2 hours to learn about the history and issues facing Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In addition to our preparation and fundraising efforts, we took time to reflect on our own lifestyles and mentally prepare for the immersion. Arrupe is not a service trip. The aim of the program is to open its participants eyes to lifestyles and hardships outside their understanding, and impact change going into the future. We feel that accompaniment and solidarity are the most valuable forces we possess. We seek to live through those who invited us into their lives, and create lasting and meaningful relations with both our in-country partners and ourselves. Due to the intricacies of the endless list of issues facing these countries, the solution is a change in the human mindset worldwide. We do not enter our host countries with supplies or construction materials, we come with nothing but ourselves. There is no quick solution that can solve these problems, so we seek to understand the problems at the core rather than offering a temporary band-aid solution. </p>

									<p>In January 2017, we landed in Santo Domingo where we spent a few days hosted by Jesuits at Manressa Loyola before bussing west to Jimani where SJM opened their quarters to us for the majority of our trip. We travelled to and across the Haiti-DR border to visit with more SJM representatives in Haiti, before spending another 2 days in the Bateys of sugar cane plantations. In our ten days, we visited schools, churches, homes, fields, and were welcomed in each space to meet our new friends. In each spot, we met incredible people, heard incredible stories, and walked with our new friends.</p>

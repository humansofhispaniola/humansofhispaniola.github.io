											<h2>Border</h2>
											<h3>Immigration, Citizenship, and Corruption</h3>
										</header>
									</div>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/gate.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>
											There is clear racism between the Dominican Republic and Haiti seen in both the legislation and the people, and the border is one of the places in which it is most obvious. In Hispaniola, lighter skin is valued more, so Dominicans are usually given more privilege than Haitians.
										</p>
										<p>
											In the United States, we have a very strict policy on entering the country, but for the D.R. and Haiti, it is much more individual (and usually relaxed), relying mostly on race. The lighter the color of your skin, the more likely you will be able to easily cross the border. If you are White, you may not even be asked for any type of documentation, but if you are Black, you will need documents, and will likely be searched and asked to pay to cross. As there is no regular system, you may be denied, and your race will be the primary reasoning for that. “You look Haitian” is a good enough reason for a Dominican military member to deny your crossing, but if you are lucky, you may be able to bribe your way in.
										</p>
										<p>
											Once you cross, you still are not safe. There are checkpoints every mile or so for about 6 miles, where you may be bribed again and again, whether or not you have documents. Again, the color of your skin has a large influence of whether or not you are charged (and how much you are charged) to continue down the road.
										</p>
										<p>
											This is an issue that many face, and is particularly difficult for migrants, as people near the border (on both sides) do not have much money. In the border town of Jimani, 73% of people live in poverty. These people do not have extra money to give when attempting to cross the border, as all the money they have is necessary for survival. This keeps many people stuck in unemployed areas, unable to make money, and unable to leave because they do not have the means to pay their way out.

											<h2>Sugar Cane Plantations</h2>
											<h3>Life in the Bateys</h3>
										</header>
									</div>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/sugar.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										A Batey is a community of sugar cane workers living on land owned by the sugar can corporation in that region. Typically, the sugar cane corporation purchases the land from the Dominican Government and uses it to house the sugar cane workers and their families. The sugar cane workers fall into three main categories: Dominican citizens, Dominicans of Haitian decent, or Haitian immigrants. The most common are Dominicans of Haitian decent and Haitian immigrants. Haitian immigrants working in the sugar cane fields often have been brought over from Haiti to the Dominican Republic by the sugar cane corporation in order to meet a demand for labor during the high crop season. The workers are promised papers that extend their stay in the Dominican Republic after their period in the sugar cane field is complete, but that promise is rarely fulfilled.
									</p>
									<p>
										The conditions in the Batey's can be compared to that of modern day slave labor. The job of cutting down sugar cane is extremely competitive, dangerous and overall unsustainable. During our visit to the field, we were told the story of a worker who killed another worker while fighting over a sugar cane plant. Workers are paid by the number of plants they cut down, which averages to about $1 per day worth that they get to take home to their family in the Batey community. Day after day, sugar cane workers are put to the test to see how much sugar cane they can cut down to support their family. The conditions are unsustainable and inhumane. Love is the only thing keeping the families in the Batey communities afloat.

											<h2>Discrimination</h2>
											<h3>Crossing the Border in Jimani</h3>
										</header>
									</div>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/cross.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										This is an after-hours scene of the Dominican side of the Dominican Republic and Haiti’s southern-most border-crossing point. The border-crossing area connects Jimaní on the Dominican side to Port-au-Prince on the Haitian side, 56.7 km (35.2 miles) away. This area operates as an open-air, duty-free marketplace for the countries to exchange goods. In addition to its commerce function, this border serves to determine who can enter either country. While Haitians can enter the DR in a controlled area to engage in trade, this border is just the first of miles of check-points making sure Haitians do not cross over into the DR permanently. Aggressive and often corrupt military guards staff these checkpoints, particularly targeting the vulnerable who are trying to make their way out of poverty into what they see as a better future. This border also serves as a place of deportation. In 2013, the DR passed a law stripping "Dominicans of Haitian descent" (people born in the DR of Haitian ancestry) of their citizenship rights. This border served to deport people who have lived in the DR their entire life, solely because of where their ancestors were from, the color of their skin, and the negative connotations of being Haitian in Dominican society.

											<h2>Basic Human Rights</h2>
											<h3>Centro Bono</h3>
										</header>
									</div>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/group.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										Centro Bonó is a Jesuit Social Center for action and reflection located in the Dominican Republic and is dedicated to confronting the social, economic, environmental, and political challenges that the country faces today. The Dominican Republic faces structural inequality and poverty, and Centro Bonó encourages Dominicans to actively participate in the construction of an inclusive society. As an Arrupe group, we met with members of Reconocí.do at the Center on our first day in the Dominican Republic to learn about these different challenges. Reconocí.do is an Independent National Civic Network made up of mainly Dominicans of Haitian descent that promotes the full and effective integration of Dominicans of Haitian descent into Dominican society. Dominicans of Haitian descent are being denied Dominican citizenship under the Dominican government, despite them being born in the Dominican Republic, some even decades ago. These fearless leaders work with the Center to travel around the country and educate people about the injustice that the government is imposing on its people. They encourage people to join their movement and fight for the rights that Dominicans deserve.

											<h2>Environmental Degradation</h2>
											<h3>Lago Enriquillo</h3>
										</header>
									</div>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/lake.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										Lake Enriquillo is a hypersaline lake in the Dominican Republic and a prime example of environmental degradation in developing areas of the world. Rapid but unsustainable development threatens areas all over the world but is especially prevalent in developing nations. The lack of technology, resources, and knowledge commonly leaves the land free of nutrients and barren. Lake Enriquillo is an example of this phenomena. The deforestation around the lake has lead to soil erosion which deposits high amounts of sodium to this once freshwater lake. The salinity in the lake an vary between 33 parts per thousand (comparable to regular seawater) and 100 parts per thousand which classifies the body of water as hyper saline. This salinity has killed many species of fish in the lake and has reduced much of the surrounding vegetation to something of a graveyard. However, two rare species of iguana and the cayman are able to live in these extreme conditions. Continued development of the surrounding mountains and farmlands will lead to soil conditions that will not be able to host any life. If the soil cannot provide food for the people, who need it to live and create a livelihood, the people will have to move.
									</p>
									<p>
										Throughout the trip, we saw many instances of how irresponsible farming techniques and practices can lead to an even lower standard of life.  The lack of funding and resources experienced by communities is alarming and will continue until the people themself can learn how to develop a way of living that will not induce harm to the surrounding environment.

											<h2>Trash Management</h2>
											<h3>Living Conditions</h3>
										</header>
									</div>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/trash.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										Discarded wrappers, bottles, and Styrofoam containers were common sites to see drifting around in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. A structured waste management system does not exist in the Dominican Republic or Haiti. The country lacks sanitary landfills. Dumping into rivers or creating improvised dumpsites is a common practice. This causes an accumulation of waste in the streets and public health risk. Water quality decreases and there is an increase in infectious diseases due to polluted water and soil.
									</p>
									<p>
										When visiting the communities we saw animals such as goats and chickens feeding on piles of trash. By ingesting trash not only are the animals subjected to many illnesses but the milk, eggs, or food products that the animal provides contain toxic chemicals that can harm the people of the communities.
									</p>
									<p>
										There are some non-for-profit organizations that function as waste management systems. These mostly exist in the Santo Domingo area.  The amount of recycling organizations are even less. People with pushcarts and street sweeping mostly collect bottles, cans, and paper.
									</p>
									<p>
										Much of the issue exists in the lack of education of environmental awareness and the harm it can cause to not only the planet but also those within the communities. Much does need to be improved until this issue can be resolved, however there are some organizations working to solve this. If these efforts continue more people will be able to make a difference and choose to dispose of waste properly.

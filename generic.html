										<h2>Environmental Degradation</h2>
										<h3>Lago Enriquillo</h3>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/lake.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										Lake Enriquillo is a hypersaline lake in the Dominican Republic and a prime example of environmental degradation in developing areas of the world. Rapid but unsustainable development threatens areas all over the world but is especially prevalent in developing nations. The lack of technology, resources, and knowledge commonly leaves the land free of nutrients and barren. Lake Enriquillo is an example of this phenomena. The deforestation around the lake has lead to soil erosion which deposits high amounts of sodium to this once freshwater lake. The salinity in the lake an vary between 33 parts per thousand (comparable to regular seawater) and 100 parts per thousand which classifies the body of water as hyper saline. This salinity has killed many species of fish in the lake and has reduced much of the surrounding vegetation to something of a graveyard. However, two rare species of iguana and the cayman are able to live in these extreme conditions. Continued development of the surrounding mountains and farmlands will lead to soil conditions that will not be able to host any life. If the soil cannot provide food for the people, who need it to live and create a livelihood, the people will have to move.
									</p>
									<p>
										Throughout the trip, we saw many instances of how irresponsible farming techniques and practices can lead to an even lower standard of life.  The lack of funding and resources experienced by communities is alarming and will continue until the people themself can learn how to develop a way of living that will not induce harm to the surrounding environment.

										<h2>Basic Human Rights</h2>
										<h3>Centro Bono</h3>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/group.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										Centro Bonó is a Jesuit Social Center for action and reflection located in the Dominican Republic and is dedicated to confronting the social, economic, environmental, and political challenges that the country faces today. The Dominican Republic faces structural inequality and poverty, and Centro Bonó encourages Dominicans to actively participate in the construction of an inclusive society. As an Arrupe group, we met with members of Reconocí.do at the Center on our first day in the Dominican Republic to learn about these different challenges. Reconocí.do is an Independent National Civic Network made up of mainly Dominicans of Haitian descent that promotes the full and effective integration of Dominicans of Haitian descent into Dominican society. Dominicans of Haitian descent are being denied Dominican citizenship under the Dominican government, despite them being born in the Dominican Republic, some even decades ago. These fearless leaders work with the Center to travel around the country and educate people about the injustice that the government is imposing on its people. They encourage people to join their movement and fight for the rights that Dominicans deserve.

										<h2>Border</h2>
										<h3>Immigration, Citizenship, and Corruption</h3>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/gate.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										There is clear racism between the Dominican Republic and Haiti seen in both the legislation and the people, and the border is one of the places in which it is most obvious. In Hispaniola, lighter skin is valued more, so Dominicans are usually given more privilege than Haitians.
									</p>
									<p>
										In the United States, we have a very strict policy on entering the country, but for the D.R. and Haiti, it is much more individual (and usually relaxed), relying mostly on race. The lighter the color of your skin, the more likely you will be able to easily cross the border. If you are White, you may not even be asked for any type of documentation, but if you are Black, you will need documents, and will likely be searched and asked to pay to cross. As there is no regular system, you may be denied, and your race will be the primary reasoning for that. “You look Haitian” is a good enough reason for a Dominican military member to deny your crossing, but if you are lucky, you may be able to bribe your way in.
									</p>
									<p>
										Once you cross, you still are not safe. There are checkpoints every mile or so for about 6 miles, where you may be bribed again and again, whether or not you have documents. Again, the color of your skin has a large influence of whether or not you are charged (and how much you are charged) to continue down the road.
									</p>
									<p>
										This is an issue that many face, and is particularly difficult for migrants, as people near the border (on both sides) do not have much money. In the border town of Jimani, 73% of people live in poverty. These people do not have extra money to give when attempting to cross the border, as all the money they have is necessary for survival. This keeps many people stuck in unemployed areas, unable to make money, and unable to leave because they do not have the means to pay their way out.

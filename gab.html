											<h3>What brings you joy?</h3>
											<blockquote>
												Deep conversations with my friends. I love being the person that someone is willing to share their deepest thoughts with. I also love being able to tell my deepest thoughts to someone who is more than willing to listen.
											</blockquote>
											<h3>How do you contribute to this goal/dream?</h3>
											<blockquote>
												I think it’s important for me to ignore those who try to bring me down or dissuade me from what I want to achieve in life. Studying hard and learning to be more involved/putting myself out there will be beneficial in the long run as well.

									<h3>What would you like to be and what would you like to achieve?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										<p>I want to be a veterinarian and treat animals. I believe animals should all be given an equal chance.</p>
										<p>Success. Not necessarily economic, although that is a piece of it. I want to feel like I am doing the job I was born to do. I want to feel like I have found happiness in all aspects of life.</p>
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What do you hope for?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										I hope for happiness and contentment.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What gives you meaning?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										My passion for animal welfare. I have always felt like I have a duty to help animals.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What is your favorite thing about the country you are from?</h3>
									<blockquote>I love going out dancing on the weekends in the Dominican Republic. I love the food and the nightlife. Everyone is so social and so focused on having a good time.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What do you identify with most in the US?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										The freedom I have to do so many things. The opportunities I have here to do or be whatever I want. The security I feel when thinking about my future.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What do you struggle with in the US?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										<p>Being Latina isn’t always an advantage. As someone who has lived the majority of her life in the US, it’s sometimes hard to know when to call myself American and when to call myself Dominican. Usually I say both.</p>
										<p>My biggest struggle right now is focusing on the present. I feel like time is flying by so quickly that all I want to do is think about the upcoming days, weeks, and years rather than focus on what is in front of me right now.</p>
									</blockquote>
									<h3>Do you have hopes for your future?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										 I dream of a happy future. Living a full life, doing a job that I love, constantly feeling like “this is what life is about,” surrounding myself with the right people who make my life worth living. I guess I dream about the typical “happy family” but sometimes it’s hard to think about something that is so far away. I really don’t have any clue what I want my future to look like. I just want to be happy.

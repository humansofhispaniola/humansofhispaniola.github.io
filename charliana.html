											<h3>What is your connection to the Dominican Republic?</h3>
											<blockquote>
												I am half Dominican and half Puerto Rican. My father was born in the Dominican Republic, as well as my step father. I have always grown up with Dominican culture in my life and I visit the country every few years. Going to the Dominican Republic always feels like going back home.
											</blockquote>
											<h3>How strongly connected do you feel to the Dominican Republic? How strongly do you feel connected to the United States?</h3>
											<blockquote>
												While I feel connected to the United States, my connection with the Dominican republic is more emotional. There is a part of my heart the pulls towards the DR and my heritage. I appreciate the privileges I have for being a U.S. citizen but my heart lies in the island. I wear a medallion everyday with the faces of the Mirabal sisters; I never take it off so I will always have a part of the DR with me.

									<h3>What is your favorite part about your culture?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										That's such a hard question to answer because there's so many amazing things about my culture, but it would have to be the passion. Dominicans are some of the most passionate groups of people in the world. Every emotion that we feel, it is felt to the maximum level. Not only that, but with the passion in Dominicans comes the ambition. Whether you're in the D.R. or the U.S., you're fighting for a better life and continue to fight until you achieve it.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What is the most difficult thing about being Dominican in the United States?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										The most difficult thing about being Dominican in the United States is the constant feeling of having to prove yourself. I always feel like there's hundreds of eyes on me, waiting for me to fail because I'm "just some Dominican chick". There's always the pressure to succeed and prove yourself in the United States.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What is something about the Dominican Republic that you struggle with? What is something about the US that you struggle with? </h3>
									<blockquote>
										I think the most that I struggle with about the Dominican Republic is the machismo in the country. Machismo is such a big theme in the Dominican culture and as a 20 year old female, it's not a part of my culture I'm proud of. The mind set that the men are in charge and their word is final is too old school and borderline barbaric to me. As for the United States, I struggle with the constant changing of immigration laws, especially now with the new presidency. I'm scared for what will become of the immigrants in the country, Dominicans and others, and how many families will be torn apart.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What do you dream for? What is the best way for people to help you/others achieve that dream?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										I dream of better days in the Dominican Republic. There is so much poverty in the country; so many places in the DR don't have access to clean water or electricity. It's completely devastating seeing how so many people are struggling in the country. If there was more support and sympathy for each other, then there would be more help for the country and things would improve slowly but surely.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What is a change youâ€™d like to see?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										I would love to see more kindness and support in the U.S. for minorities.  The racial tensions in the U.S. are very intense and only hurt the country and its people. Not every minority in the country is there illegally and not every immigrant is trying to feed off the country, but these are the stereotypes in the U.S. that make life difficult for minorities in the country.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What makes you happy?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										Nothing makes me happier than my family and my culture. They are the two essential pillars in my life and without them, I don't know what I would do.

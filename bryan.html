											<h3>What do you Hope for?</h3>
											<blockquote>
												<p>I hope to make my people proud. I know I’m making my family proud but I want to do more. I want to make my culture proud. It is such a complex and often misunderstood culture, and is so much deeper and richer than it is explained as right now commonly. I hope someday to explain more deeply what it means to be Dominican and be a spokesperson for that.</p>
												<p><p>I also hope to go back to the DR one day and address some of the social justice issues present there. I think one of the biggest issues I want to learn more about is the idea of colorism. I want to go back and experience the issues, and see what it is like to be there as someone who has an American education and an American way of thinking, yet still be Dominican in terms of culture. I want to go back and fully embrace the culture because at times I can feel myself being detached since I am away from the Island.</p></p>

									<h3>What is your connection to the Dominican Republic?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										I was born in the Dominican Republic in San Francisco de Macorís. I lived there until I was eight years old, and then I moved to the United States.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What's your favorite memory of the DR?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										Christmas was always my favorite time of year. In the DR, the whole month of December is amazing, and Christmas is celebrated very differently in the DR than it is in the United States. We celebrate the whole month up until the 24th, and spend the whole month celebrating different traditions and having festivities. In the DR, the celebrations are very much so tied to religion. I would really love to recreate it here in the US.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What makes you the most proud of the Dominican Republic?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										The people we produce. You can tell when someone is a Dominican. I don’t like stereotyping people into a box, but you can tell, and this is often something that we Dominicans talk about. We are so prideful of our culture, and I feel our culture has become so saturated into American culture, and that's something I take pride in. I am proud that Dominicans are making such a huge influence in the US. I can see so many elements of the Latin-American culture in the United States that are products of our culture, and I’m so proud of that.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What is your biggest struggle?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										Right now I’m struggling in terms of being fully vocal about the things I face as a person of color. Even when people of my own culture or background talk about it with me, both sides of the community seem to push back. I struggle with people not fully understanding me when I say that I am Afro-Latino. Nobody would doubt it if you said you were Irish, but people doubt me when I say I’m Afro-Latino. I don’t believe that saying I’m Dominican fully emcompasses my identity. I also feel like many Dominicans aren’t ready to face the reality that we need to challenge our identities and our history.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What’s your favorite thing about the US?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										For me it has been meeting all different types of people. When I was growing up I was too young to know there was anything outside the DR. You come to the US and you are challenged because you meet people who talk differently and act differently. It has been so interesting to meet so many people and learn a little more about the world through each interaction you have.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What is one thing you struggle with in the US?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										I struggle deeply with my racialized identity. I feel like in the US you need to fit a certain box. I get a lot of questions like where are you from. People want to know where I fit. I think this is from the way I’ve been brought up. A lot of the people in the DR don’t realize that they are black, and this is part of the struggle that I have. I identify as Afro-Latino. In the DR, that isn't recognized. In the DR, the racial system is not based on race, but on color and the part of the Island from which you're from, so coming to America, I believed I was white because of my skin color. It took me a long time to learn that I was not, and I struggled with this.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What do you want to do after College?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										I am really interested in social justice, and in pursuing issues related to that field after college. I came to BC on the pre-med track because I was taught there were three careers that could make change: doctors, lawyers and engineers. I think a lot of the issues in our societies now concern marginalizing communities, and those affect me. I ended up dropping pre-med, and turned to educational reform. In the US, our issues should no longer be about equality, but about equity, and this lack of thinking leads to unequal educational opportunities. People sometimes don’t realize this, and that is what I want to focus on. I want to expose the reality of what it is like to be a student of color in America, and that needs to start with a discussion on the systems that affect this status.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What is something you wish you could teach every BC student about the Dominican Republic?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										Every Dominican person is unique. We all have things that set us apart, and you can’t just generalize what a Dominican is like. As Dominicans we get to joke around and say that we are loud, but it doesn’t feel good when others generalize our entire culture as being so. I feel like students sometimes who aren’t as vocally Dominican, but are still wholly Dominican can get generalized. It is important that it is understood that Dominicans encompass such a wide range of people. So when people say ‘you don’t have this quality or this characteristic’ I want to tell that that we are such a wide range of people. The DR has such a wide range of influences on society, and such a rich culture. You can’t clearly define what a Dominican looks like or is like, and that’s the most interesting thing about our culture.

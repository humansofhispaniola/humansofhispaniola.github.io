										It was beautiful chaos. Children running wildly around us, laughing and calling out in a turmoil of Spanish and Creole. A massive soccer game was underway, players intricately dancing around each other while the ball ricocheted off the hard ground on its own, untamable trajectory. Dogs barked, pigs scuffled, roosters crowed. In the distance, mountains threw their craggy peaks to the sky, a dark clash with the scarlet of the sun in all its fading glory. All around me, life was speeding along with reckless abandon, and yet I was moving in slow motion, engaged in conversation with a man named Lezaire.
									</p>
									<p>
										Lezaire was a Haitian immigrant living in the Dominican Republic. He was tall and thin, wearing an oversized shirt (the words Catch Beaver Fever! emblazoned across the back). I learned many things over the course of our short conversation: I learned about Lezaire’s family, who still lives in Haiti and Lezaire hasn’t seen in over six years. I learned about Lezaire’s difficulties in supporting not only himself, but his family, off the meager salary available to Haitian immigrants living in the Dominican Republic. I learned about racism and poverty and the ugliness that humankind is capable of showing.
									</p>
									<p>
										And yet, these aren’t the things that I think of when I remember our conversation. Rather, I think of the openness, the bravery, and the simple, beautiful willingness this man had to share a piece of himself with me. The most vivid impression I hold of Lezaire is his smile. To say it was bright does not do it justice; he positively beamed with a brilliance that put the setting sun to shame. We shared human connection, at its very purest, as we laughed over our French grammar mistakes and admired the mountains. I came away from this conversation filled with a sense of awe, because despite the fact that I was only in the Dominican Republic for an 8 day immersion trip, this was Lezaire’s reality and he invited me in with his whole heart.

										<h2>How to Understand the Differences?</h2>

									<p>
										It is hard for us to judge something without using our own standard. We usually think what is good for us is also good for others. So does the opposite works. If you hear a girl who did not go to college but open her own start-up business and is able to make a living on her own, what do you think of this girl? Maybe she would not able to earn a large amount money by having a small pizza store in her community. Maybe she needs a higher degree. However, do you know that most people around her are also never able to go to college. And they only wait for people from other countries to save their lives rather than work on their own. This girl does not have a college degree, but this is not an abnormal case in her country. We should not use our standard to judge what she lacks. Also, even though a pizza shop cannot bring her much income, she is able to make a living by herself rather than depending on others. She is greater than most people around her, even though in our standard, it might not be a big deal.

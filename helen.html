											<h3>What would you like to be?</h3>
											<blockquote>
												<p>I definitely want to do humanitarian work. I’m not sure where because it seems like the world is in shambles right now, but all of these stories about what’s happening in Syria and places where you aren’t getting a lot of coverage make me want to do something. I find it difficult to choose because I don’t want to dip my toe in a little and then leave forever, but anyway I could help out is something I really want to do in the future. Even though you have your own struggles, you have to put things in perspective and see other people may be in worse situations.</p>
												<p>I want to get into broadcasting. I don’t want to just do reporting, but I want to be a credible source that people look to not just for sports, but I want to bring the social justice aspects of my life and the things that are important to me to the platform. It seems to me that a lot of different outlets are trying to embrace social awareness, I’m not sure why, but I think it’s important for people that are on the platform to use it for issues that are important to them, whether that be environmental issues, social justice, inequality, etc.</p>
											</blockquote>
											<h3>What do you hope for?</h3>
											<blockquote>
												Peace, it’s so cliche, but I would hope that some of this unrest in this world could just be resolved in a way that’s good for everybody.

									<h3>How do you contribute to your goal/dream?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										Whatever platform I get to reach in the future, I think it’s important to not just be a bystander and let your voice be diminished because you’re only focused on doing your job. In reality, people want to hear from other people and know that these things are being talked about. The worst thing that could happen is that these issues are swept aside. I don’t want to just be a sportscaster, I want to be able to talk for people who don’t have voices.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What gives you meaning?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										My family gives me meaning, but I also have expectations for myself, and I do get frustrated when I don’t achieve them. I want to represent my culture and my people, I’m Dominican and Puerto Rican, I’m from New York and a low income neighborhood, and I want to show everyone that you can do anything.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What is your favorite thing about the country you are from?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										<p>My dad is from Dominican Republic and my mom is from Puerto Rico, and they’re two countries that supposedly hate each other, but in reality they have very similar cultures and foods, and I love the family aspect, vibrancy, and loudness. We own up to our loudness, but it’s a great thing because it shows how passionate we are about things.</p>
										<p>I love baseball, it’s ingrained in me. My brother played baseball all through little league and plays in college now, and I saw how passionate people were just about these little kids playing in a park, and that’s what got me into sports. I saw how fans reacted and came together, and whether it’s baseball or a party, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans can come together and enjoying each other's’ company all through the night.</p>
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What do you identify with most in the US?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										I really do believe in the mixing pot. I know there is unrest, but I do like that you can go to one neighborhood and find this kind of food and go to another and find these clothes, just in one city. You can go across the country and see different communities and cultural values that you wouldn’t be able to see in a lot of other countries. I think it’s cool that people can come here and share and assimilate in a way. Slowly people’s values and cultures start to assimilate and create some hybrid cultures that you wouldn’t have thought of before.
									</blockquote>
									<h3>What do you struggle with in the US?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										<p>Colorism. I benefit because I am a lighter skin tone, but it’s still something you have to deal with because people will make a judgment about you. It’s not just for Hispanics, it’s for anybody. Everybody has to deal with colorism in some sense, wherever you go. I don’t want to say it’s something I struggle with because it’s something that I face, and I think there’s a difference between struggling with something and facing something. </p>
										<p>The way I interact with people will change their ideas, but I don’t want to prove stereotypes. Not keeping those stereotypes alive is something I struggle with.</p>
									</blockquote>
									<h3>Do you have hopes for your children?</h3>
									<blockquote>
										 I hope they can also embrace the culture I grew up in. They always say that it’s easier to learn another language if you’re brought up in it, and I hope to do that for my children because I think it’s important to have that culture near you. I would hate for them to lose something that was so integral and a part of me. It keeps you connected. I would also hope that they have an easier transition throughout school. Struggle is a part of life and you learn from it, and my parents and I have gone through it, but I would want for them to not have to go through it.
